# Global rules for SchoolQuiz

- This is a Next.js app using the App Router.

- There is an existing basic admin area that will be replaced by a new admin at `/admin`.

- There is an existing "Achievement Creator" feature in the current admin. 

  - This MUST be preserved and eventually migrated into the new admin.

  - Do NOT delete or break it. Later phases will integrate it properly.

- Data is stored in Postgres (likely via Supabase). Reuse existing quiz/session/score schemas and services. 

  - Do NOT invent a completely separate quiz model unless explicitly instructed.

- Use TypeScript everywhere. Avoid `any`.

- Use the existing UI system (shadcn/ui + project UI components). Do NOT introduce new UI libraries.

- Admin routes live under `app/admin/*`.

  - The new admin must provide: Overview, Organisations, Users, Quizzes, Scheduling, Analytics, Billing, Support, System, and Achievements (Achievement Creator).

- Respect roles: PlatformAdmin, OrgAdmin, Teacher, Student, Parent.

  - Only admins (at minimum PlatformAdmin) should access `/admin/*`.
